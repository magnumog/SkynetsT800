i) The getDistancePointToSegment can be used to check for collisions between a link and the circular object,
   because the get distanePoint to segment measures the distance from the center of the circular object to the line created by the base of
   robot and link. If this distance is less than the distance of the radius of the circel and the link radius 
   there is a possibility that the objects collide.

iv) The reason to that only the second link is hitting the obstacle is the distance from the base of the arm is in 0,0 and the distance(manhattan distance) 
    from the base to the center of the circle is 1,4142 this means that the first link will not reach it because it is not long enough.

ii) >> testCollisionDetection

    Testing polygon collision detector

    No collision check passed
    Vertex collision check passed
    Segment collision check passed
    Coincident collision check passed

    Timing 1000 collision checks

    No collision time: 1.171875 secs
    Vertex collision time: 0.734375 secs
    Segment collision time: 0.312500 secs

iii) This is the case because the algorithm returns true if it finds a point which is colliding with another segment, but if it does not find any
     points which is colliding it has to run the whole algorothm and this takes longer time beacue it has to search every point in both polygons
     to try to detect a collision.
