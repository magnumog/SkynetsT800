i) 	To extract the rotation axis and angle from the rotation matrix I whould do the following
    start by making the identiy matrix for the n dimensions, then calculate the skew matrix
    from the matrix you have been given. Calculate the power of the skew matrix, and then insert
    the calculated stuff into the formula. Which is Rotn(?)=I3+sin ?ñ+(1 ? cos ?)ñ
