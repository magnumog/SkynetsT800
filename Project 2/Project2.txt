iii) 	The angles of the polygons are defined by the x and y value in the shown roadmap, the first links angel is given by the x axis value and the
	second link angle is given by the y value. The translation for the first link is given by its base point(which it rotates around), the 	second
	links translation and rotation point is given by the point it is conected to the first link. The degree of rotation is the difference between
	the goal and start node.

Part 2
iv) 	The slowest part of the code is the part where you compute the adjacency table, this is you have to check for every point against each other
	if the points are within the connectivity radius of the other point. if it is you must add it to the adjtable, if not the points are not connected.

v)	To make the connection rule guarantee connectivity I whould just sett a connectivity radius which is so big I know the graph will be connected,
	the problem here is that if you make the radius to big the graph will connect in areas which the robots are not allowed to move.
	To solve this problem and make the connection rule secure I whould find the distance from one random point to every other point and then take the
	average of these distances to find the best connection radius. This whould hopefully find a good radius and make the graph connected and secure.
