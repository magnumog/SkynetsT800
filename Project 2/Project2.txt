Part 2
iv) 	The slowest part of the code is the part where you compute the adjacency table, this is because the uniform grid is randomly
	choosen and therefore you may have many points which is connected. Because they lay inside the maxRadius distance
	The worst case is where all the points is connected to eachother because they all are inside the maxRadius distance,
	then all the points whould be connected and the runtime whould be O(n^2)

v)	The changes whould do to the connection rule to make it guarabtee connectivity is.....
